Neuro AI meeting

Jean-Baptiste Masson - operant conditioning in larvae.
    Venkatasubramanian in review
    Croteau-Chonka
        TH-GAL4

    infomax, AIM
    neuromodulation changes network spectrum

Blake Richards - representational geometry in self-supervised learning
    What happens? during self-supervised.
    how do you know if its learning well?

    m repr x n neurons - correlation, then eigenvalues - variance, PC dimmesions

    alpha power law - representation
    Stringer 2019
    alpha is high - low d

    alpha is 1.04 in mouse visual cortex. alpha=1, important, chaos threshold.
    optimal for generalization - another mention - Hillel Adesnik.
    Agrawal 2022

    So then use alpha to understand SSL 1 + 2

    Need to understand spectral analysis.

    alpha is optimal around 1. cool.

    Auer et al. 
    Zbontar et al 2021

    Super cool! transitions in the in the alpha spectrum. entropy-seeking, then compressoing seeking.

    Pythia models. Even if loss is monotonic, alpha and stuff is doing weird stuff.

    What does alpha mean for capabilities? n-gram - correlation - memorization
        TriviaQA vs. SciQ

Shuchen Wu
    chunking in LLMs?

Lukas Braun - not all solutions are the same.
    Neural neetworks are overparameterised
    function varies independetly of  represenstation

Christian Schmid - James Murray - Learning
